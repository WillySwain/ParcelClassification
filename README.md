# ParcelClassification
### How to run
#### 1. Make sure the badpackages and goodpackages directories are empty in data/split data 
#### 2. Run all of the cells in order and a model will be trained on the data in the startingdata directory.

If you would like to start with new uncleaned data, delete startingdata, uncomment all of the crawl calls, and run the first cell.
