# ParcelClassification
### How to run
#### 1. Make sure the badpackages and goodpackages directories are empty in data/split data 
#### 2. Run all of the cells in order and a ResNet50 model will be trained on the data in the startingdata directory.
<br>
If you would like to start with new uncleaned data, delete startingdata, uncomment all of the crawl calls, and run the first cell.
